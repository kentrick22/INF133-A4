4. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
None


5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
Please install lottie-player under the sleeptracker folder (npm install --save @teamhive/lottie-player).
For more information, visit: https://dev.to/teamhive/using-lottie-animations-inside-angular-or-ionic-4-5c48. Additionally, we included background image, DM Sans typeface, and change the primary color of the system; they are all accessible through ..\sleeptracker\src\app\home\assets.

--Aim for no more than two sentences for each of the following questions.--


6. Did you design your app with a particular type of user in mind? If so, whom?
We want this to be accessible to everyone with various technical background, particularly those who are not tech-savvy and hence, we incorporate cards functionality and iconography to streamline the navigation process and make the app more intuitive to use.


7. Did you design your app specifically for iOS or Android, or both?
We design it specifically for iOS. We try to follow iOS conventions, such as the navbar convention.


8. How can a person log overnight sleep in your app? Why did you choose to support logging overnight sleep in this way?
The user can go to the Overnight tab in the navbar and then log the sleep by clicking the add button on the top right.
We chose to implement it this way because it follows the convention for iOS, where add button usually appears on the top right.


9. How can a person log sleepiness during the day in your app? Why did you choose to support logging sleepiness in this way?
The user can go to the Sleepiness tab in the navbar and then log the sleepiness by clicking the add button on the top right.
We chose to implement it this way because it follows the convention for iOS, where add button usually appears on the top right.



10. How can a person view the data they logged in your app? Why did you choose to support viewing logged data in this way?
The user can go to the Overnight tab in the navbar to view logged data in card view. We chose it this way because we think that
it will be easier for the user to look at the previous data if we divide them into card view.


11. Which feature choose--using a native device resource, backing up logged data, or both?
Backing up logged data.


12. If you used a native device resource, what feature did you add? How does this feature change the app's experience for a user?
N/A


13. If you backed up logged data, where does it back up to?
It backs up to the local storage.


14. Did you add any "extra" features, such as other data to log, the ability to edit or delete data, or changes to the styling of the app? If so, what did you add? How do these add to the experience of the app?
We styled the app so that it mostly utilizes cards to display data and information. Cards functionality are commonly implemented in nowadays' apps as they are intuitive and easy to digest. Additionally, we incorporated multiple icons to signify each data (for instance, the Sleepiness data is associated with the "Moon" icon) so that it decreases users' memory load and increase the overall user experience. We also changed the variable.scss to incorporate the DM Sans typeface and change the primary color into a shade of pink to match our design system better.
